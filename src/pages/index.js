          This site is a growing collection of my thoughts and experiences while
          working on software. Some of it is short or incomplete, others are
          ideas that turned out to be completely wrong. My hope is that by
          sharing my personal journey I can help others in some way.

          I write most often about design systems and the process around
          building them. Some of these are hard-earned lessons, others are the
          craziest of experiments. Other times, I'll share more about my
          personal journey navigating my own career and life.

          In terms of this place, it's very much so at the beginning. I'm
          excited to grow it throughout the year, and I'm hoping that what I
          share can help you in some way.
