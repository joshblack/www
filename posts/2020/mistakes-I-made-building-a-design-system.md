- Intro
  - Have been working on a design system the last couple of years
  - Inherited codebase that's been around
  - Some of the biggest mistakes we've made
    - Doing a ComponentV2 naming scheme
    - Not communicating semver up front
      - CSS changes
    - Not focusing on accessibility from the beginning
    - Multiple packages
