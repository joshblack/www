Changes happen, sometimes you want to refactor/edit/change a component after you've learned more from teams or just more about what works/doesn't work.

How should you go about deprecating a component?

- Helpers in react
  - Deprecate prop type
  - Migrating prop names
- Feature flags for components (avoid V2 naming)
