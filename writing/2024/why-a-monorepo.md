tl;dr

- When packages are coupled
  - You would like to release two packages at the same time, in lockstep
- It makes it easier to develop
- It makes it easier to maintain
- Challenges
  - Things can grow, quickly, and tooling needs to accommodate for that
  - Sometimes you'll want to decouple releases
  - Making large scale changes can be difficult to release without decoupling releases
